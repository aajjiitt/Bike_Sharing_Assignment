## General Information
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
- What is the background of your project?</br>
  BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic.

- What is the business problem that your project is trying to solve?</br>
 To maximize the revenue and analyze different factors that impact the demand of boombikes
- What is the dataset that is being used?</br>
 We are analyzing the data set of two years 2018 and 2019 from boombikes.
